			<h2>A Year Ago Today: Day 1: Sapporo</h2>
			<h3>Day 0: Arriving in Sapporo</h3>
			<p>Getting into Sapporo wasn't too difficult. My flight was so long (it was nearly 13 hours!) and was very crowded (don't travel to or in Japan during Golden Week!). My connection was quick, although I needed to re-enter security. Staff at the ANA counter printed off my next flight's ticket and sent me off in the right direction. I made my flight with a bit of time to spare. Leaving CTS was a bit of a challenge, as some of the signage was lacking... But eventually I understood what to do -- the trains were downstairs, and then it was easy to just search for an express to Sapporo Station.<p>
			
			<p>The real fun began as I headed out, sun setting on the horizon. I had travelled almost halfway across the globe -- I was really doing this. My adventure was finally beginning. As I entered Sapporo Station, there was a feeling that started to creep in. Whether it was the change in advertisements, the way people just flowed around you, the cleanliness of the stations... The bike scattered about, the chatter, the bright neon lights... It really hit me when I exited the Susukino metro station: <b>Japan is cool</b>.</p>

			<p>I eventually reached my hostel, <a href="http://socialhostel365.com/en/">Social 365</a>, not long after. It's a really nice place, and very affordable. The beds look really cool (like tree forts) and are very cozy with a lot of privacy (there's also room to stash a backpack!). I would highly recommend it again. Of course, after travelling for more than 16 hours, the only objective is to find your bed and sleep in it... I paid for my bed, picked up my SIM cards I ordered by mail, and got ready for bed. Travelling is tiring!</p>
			
			<h3>Day 1: Searching for Blossoms</h3>
			<p> I started the day very early -- I guess jetlag really kicked in at this point (I didn't sleep from the moment I set foot in the Ottawa Airport). I woke up around 6am and couldn't fight it, so I decided it was time to head out. I decided it was time to go look for some blossoms, and become acquainted with the city.</p>
			
			<p>I know most of us think Japan is some ultra-grey industrial site, but there actually is greenspace -- at least up here in Sapporo, it seems like there's plenty to go around. I ended up taking a stroll through Odori Park (大通公園), which was already very lively (although no cherry blossoms really -- I think they must not have any here, or they've already bloomed and fallen). I hear Hokkaido is big on tulips, which was nice! For those who don't know, Ottawa is flooded with tulips around May every year, a gift from the Dutch Royal Family.</p>

			<p>I had a hunch from my hostel that the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/43%C2%B003'50.3%22N+141%C2%B020'52.4%22E/@43.063968,141.347899,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d43.063968!4d141.347899?hl=en">Former Hokkaidō Government Office</a> would have some blossoms still on its lawn, or at least in the park near it.</p>
