			<h2>A Year Ago Today: My Japan Trip</h2>
			<p>I realized a few weeks ago, I never actually put fingers to key and typed up my journal entries from my trip. Now, I don't think many of us blog about <i>all</i> of our vacation experiences, but considering I've spent most of the last year raving about my experience, I thought it was about time I uploaded my journal entries! I'm hoping to go back and do the entire stretch, coinciding with a year since I left off.</p>
			
			<p>I'm supplementing it with additional information where important -- tips and tricks to help anyone else who might be thinking about it make the experience as smooth as possible. I'd just like to preface by saying, though, that Japan was <i>by far</i> the best country I've travelled to yet in terms of convenience and sense of safety. Everything is easily accessible, the <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/">Japan Guide</a> is a treasure unlike which I've ever seen before, and you really can't underestimate how much good transportation links can impact a trip.</p>
			
			<p>I left, alone, without Japanese contacts, for 35 days. Originally it was to be closer to a month -- and originally I was supposed to go with friends -- but life always presents twists and turns. The price for 35 days was exactly the same as 30, and I figured I could always use the extra time -- I had also saved up a hefty sum in my co-op terms to be able to do this. I had, for a student, an "unlimited" budget, and so was not afraid of a few extra days. Two days after my return would be my convocation, and three days after, my sister's graduation, two dates I was making sure not to miss. I figured that would leave me enough time in case of problems.</p>
			
			<p>So let's dive in from the start...</p>
			
			<h3>My Itinerary</h3>
			
			<p> I actually planned my itinerary around the availability of the flights and the cherry blossoms schedule for that year. It was a bit cooler in Japan from what I hear, so the blossoms went off a bit later, but not dramatically so. Hakodate and Sapporo were forecasted to be in full bloom when I would arrive. Now, if you're not familiar with Japan's cherry blossoms, I really recommend you read the <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2011_when.html">Japan Guide article</a> on them. It's a beautiful, breath-taking experience that you might only get to see a few times as a foreigner; travel in those weeks can be difficult, as the window of opportunity might slide. Originally the forecast said I'd miss it completely -- then I'd actually arrive too early -- and finally, that Sapporo would be in full bloom. In the end, it wasn't at all -- some late bloomers (thankfully the wise people who plant flowering trees found other cultivars that bloom earlier and later) stuck around, but most of them were gone, and most viewing parties had ended.
			
			It was enough to get a few nice moments under the trees, but not enough for something like this:

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>I'd still strongly recommend trying to get to your destination in cherry blossom season if you can (it's usually between early March and late April depending on where it is in the country), but do know you might have to change plans as you might be off by as much as a week. It's not an easy science.</p>
			
			<p>My plan then was to stay in the following cities, in this order:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Sapporo</li>
				<li>Fukuoka</li>
				<li>Beppu</li>
				<li>Nagasaki</li>
				<li>Hiroshima</li>
				<li>Matsuyama (via Shiminami Kaido)</li>
				<li>Naoshima</li>
				<li>Kyoto</li>
				<li>Tsumago</li>
				<li>Kanazawa</li>
				<li>Nikko</li>
				<li>Tokyo</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p class="two">(Of course, I never got around to getting to Nikko ;) ...)</p>
			
			<p>One thing to be aware of is that although Japanese hosts are very hospitable and will go the extra mile to help you, they <i><b>abhor</b></i> the idea of a drop-in guest. Never show up unannounced -- always make sure to call, click, or get a tourist office (or your current place) to fax a reservation request. One amazing tip -- I used booking.com (I'm not affiliated with them or anything) and most of the places had free cancellation up to 24 hours before. Hostelworld didn't have that, and some places on booking.com had almost no cancellation, so be warned! If you can find places that allow changes like that, book your spots as you're planning your trip, and make adjustments periodically. You'll be able to hold onto your trickier reservations that way and have to worry. Most of the places I booked weren't ever packed, but sometimes it can be stressful, especially around Obon, Hanami season, Golden Week, or New Years!</p>
			
			<p>I travelled by rail for the most part, using a Japan Rail Pass. I would highly recommend it. There's plenty of reading material on the web on how to travel by rail in Japan and how to use the Rail Pass. If you're strapped for cash, and you're not doing too many hops, it's sometimes cheaper to just pay per use. It might also be feasible to ride only local trains (which are much cheaper than the high speed ones), and fly via discount carriers for large hops. There's also a few highway bus companies, some of which run night buses. I hate sleeping while in transit, so that was not an option for me.</p>
			
			<p>Another good option I uncovered when I was doing my research, <a href="https://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/wws_common/promotions/share/experience_jp/">ANA</a> and <a href="https://www.world.jal.com/world/en/japan_explorer_pass/ar/">JAL</a> offered discounted domestic flights if you flew in on their alliance -- OneWorld for JAL and Star Alliance for ANA. Even if you didn't, the discount is available at a slightly worse rate if you buy a minimum of two tickets. At the time, it would be roughly ¥10,000 on any domestic flight, fees and taxes included. I paid roughly 120 CAD to fly from Sapporo to Fukuoka -- normally a $600 flight! However, if I did this on budget airlines, I might have been ok as well. Japan's budget airlines are good and worth exploring, especially for popular destinations like Sapporo and Naha.</p>
			
			<p>I flew into the country via Haneda, direct from Toronto, which I would highly recommend again. The airport is a lot smaller than Narita, is a lot more convenient to access (although right away I connected towards Sapporo). I would only fly through Narita if your goal is to connect in and out, or if you get a good discount or otherwise a good flight. Some flights leave Haneda at awkward times, because policy is that it is a domestic airport now. However, the travel time is more than half (twenty minutes on the monorail from the JR loop line, or twenty five from Asakusa via commuter rail, versus nearly an hour from Shinjuku for Narita. The cost is also way more -- almost a ¥4,000 difference in some cases).</p>
			
			<p>Tokyo is the best place to start and end your journey, as you will find everything you need there, and the flights are usually cheaper. Don't be afraid to start or end in Osaka, Fukuoka, even Sapporo, but usually leaving from a bigger city means one last chance to grab things you can't get back home, and starting from a bigger city leads to cheaper connections to other destinations. I'm happy I connected right away to Sapporo -- I think starting in Tokyo would have been incredibly overwhelming.</p>
			
			<p>I ended up organizing it all on Google Sheets, which was a huge boon -- I could then easily display how much time I had between destinations, what was within reach, and guestimate how much many nights I'd spend where. I had some hard deadlines -- the flight between Sapporo and Fukuoka is once a day; my booking at Tsumago was fixed; but most of the others were flexible. Rather than just dump the spreadsheet on here, I'd like to invite you instead to read through the other posts as they come online -- and when they're all done, I'll try and build a fancy web-two-point-oh timeline here for you to see.</p>
