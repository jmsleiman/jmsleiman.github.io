talk about orders of retrievability for organization, and what each methodn entails --

when you need a precise item (this shirt, that wrench)

when you want the oldest always (eg canned goods)
when you want the newest always (not so sure tbh)

and how the different storage methods play into that

also 1-2-3-etc degrees/properties
